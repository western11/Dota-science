# Dota-science

This project is based on an old Kaggle competition. The training set consists of matches, for which all of the ingame events (like kills, item purchase etc.) as well as match outcomes are known. We are given only the first 5 minutes of each match and need to predict the likelihood of Radiant victory. You can found all the datasets and the competition here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dota-2-prediction/overview). As you can see from the kaggle page, there’s only 2 notebooks and it doesn’t tell that much. So we’re going to build the prediction from scratch.
